    A SourceFtp reads data from a given FTP Server.

    All the complexity is hidden for the end user.
    The SourceFtp can automatically download the desired files from the FTP Server.
    Selection of the remote files is based on the filenames, and operates inside one or many remote folders.
    The selection is operated thanks to the f_match() function that could be a regex or whatever you want.
    Once the files are downloaded (into a temp dir), the connection to the FTP Server is closed.
    Then the Source reads the downloaded files to deliver rows as usual, by iterating on file records.
    At the end, when the Source is closed, the temp dir is cleaned.
